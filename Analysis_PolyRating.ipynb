To start off, Chem 124 is the \"weeder\" class for incoming freshmen, and I was absolutely terrible at chem in high school. Therefore, I was dreading taking a college level chem course. As a great suprise, Dr. Abel changed my attitude towards chem for the better with her concise lectures and friendly personality. I understood chem much better with her as a teacher, and she goes out of the way to make sure you understand the course material. She provides many supplemental handouts for practice, plenty of office hours, and even gives an extra assignment towards the end of the quarter to help your grade out (I don\\'t know any other chem professor that does this). In addition, she\\'s a very fair grader and curves the final grades nicely. Suffice it to say, Chem 124/125 is a difficult class to conquer. However, with substantial effort and help from Dr. Abel I was able to not just survive, but get a good grade. I had Dr. Zumwalt for 125 and quickly missed having Dr. Abel for chem.

Obviously she is just out of industry, so teaching an entry level class might not be the best for her (because she doesn't remember any of the material from when she learned it), but I think she should still be able to put in the extra effort needed to learn the material through and through before teaching a lecture on it. I kid you not, she literally will hold a piece of paper in front of her face with the notes on it while she copies them down onto the whiteboard for us to write down. The only problem with that is that most of the time she doesn't even copy the notes correctly, so you're always sitting there trying to decipher what she just wrote. Of course, she's trying to do the same, so it's just a bad combination. If you can, take marshall for this class over abercromby, but honestly, both teachers aren't the greatest. the only reason i suggest marshall is because he has been teaching the class for awhile, so at least he knows the material.

Everyone should know that she only has one quarter of teaching under her belt (Spring 2009), so lets give her a break. It was also her first time teaching AERO 451, Spaceflight Dynamics I, in the Spring and while I wasn\\\\\\'t disappointed with her teaching style, I could easily see how some would be. \\r Let\\\\\\'s start with the positives: she has a sense of humor, her help in office hours is invaluable and she\\\\\\'s a consistent and fair grader. Negatives: relative inexperience (this will likely fade), is very much a \\\\\"regurgitator\\\\\", that is, she basically taught us right out of the Orbtial Mechanics book by Curtis, and she does occasionally make mistakes. She provides an example every time she explains a new concept, which is really helpful. Usually the example comes from the text, or perhaps it\\\\\\'s an unassigned HW problem, but to me it didn\\\\\\'t matter. It helped a lot to have her explain the concept and then do some kind of example. \\r Anyways, I don\\\\\\'t find fault in her inexperience...she\\\\\\'ll get the hang of things without a doubt. Teaching us out of the book...that\\\\\\'s not so bad either, because Curtis is a good book and whenever she felt Curtis was wrong, she wouldn\\\\\\'t hesitate to say so and provide her own insight. The mistakes in class come from being under-prepared in my honest opinion. I think that problem will likely be remedied in future classes where she has past experience to build upon.\\r If you dislike being taught out of the book and don\\\\\\'t want to go to lecture and would rather read and just learn from the book...you could probably do that in this case, at least, that was my experience. \\r The grading structure was split up into HW/1 Midterm/Project/Final. The homework was probably the most important part of the class because it prepared you for the midterm (which I did miserably on, but still pulled a B - a testament to her fair grading because I showed improvement), the project and the final. You really learn all of the fundamentals and concepts through the HW, so don\\\\\\'t think about not doing it. Also, there is a pretty heavy reliance on the Aero\\\\\\'s mortal enemy MATLAB in this course. You could probably scrape by without touching MATLAB, but I don\\\\\\'t recommend it. Get friendly with it and write some code. Not only will it make your homework and project easier, but you\\\\\\'ll have some good code to use in the future. Abercromby will not hesitate to look at your code if you\\\\\\'re having trouble with it either and she will help you debug it line by line if necessary. \\r All things considered, I have hope for this woman. I think she\\\\\\'ll come into her own and become a very good professor. Just give her a chance. At this point, I think she has more redeeming qualities and potential than anyone else in the department. I do believe she\\\\\\'ll be the go to professor for 451 from now on, so you won\\\\\\'t have a choice but to take her.

Watch aerial footage of the area �\\r\\r\"The amazing thing was, we saw it within hours of it beginning, in between the morning and the afternoon pictures of that day,\" Scambos said of the large chunk that broke away on February 28.\\r\\rThe Wilkins ice shelf lost about 6 percent of its surface a decade ago, the British Antarctic Survey said in a statement on its Web site\\r\\rAnother 220 square miles -- including the chunk that Scambos spotted -- had splintered from the ice shelf as of March 8, the group said.\\r\\rDon\\'t Miss\\rPlanet in peril \\rGiant sea creatures found in Antarctic search \\rU.N.: Glaciers shrinking at record rate \\r\"As of mid-March, only a narrow strip of shelf ice was protecting several thousand kilometers of potential further breakup,\" the group said. \\r\\rScambos\\' center put the size of the threatened shelf at about 5,282 square miles, comparable to the state of Connecticut, or about half the area of Scotland.  See a map and photos as the collapse progressed �\\r\\rOnce Scambos called the British Antarctic Survey, the group sent an aircraft on a reconnaissance mission to examine the extent of the breakout.\\r\\r\"We flew along the main crack and observed the sheer scale of movement from the breakage,\" said Jim Elliott, according to the group\\'s Web site.\\r\\r\"Big hefty chunks of ice, the size of small houses, look as though they\\'ve been thrown around like rubble -- it\\'s like an explosion,\" he said.\\r\\r\"Wilkins is the largest ice shelf on the Antarctic Peninsula yet to be threatened,\" David Vaughan of the British Antarctic Survey said, according to the Web site. \\r\\r\"I didn\\'t expect to see things happen this quickly. The ice shelf is hanging by a thread -- we\\'ll know in the next few days or weeks what its fate will be.\"\\r\\rBut with Antarctica\\'s summer ending, Scambos said the \"unusual show is over for this season.\"\\r\\rIce shelves are floating ice sheets attached to the coast. Because they are already floating, their collapse does not have any effect on sea levels, according to the Cambridge-based British Antarctic Survey.\\r\\rScambos said the ice shelf is not currently on the path of the increasingly popular tourist ships that travel from South America to Antarctica. But some plants and animals may have to adapt to the collapse.\\r\\r\"Wildlife will be impacted, but they are pretty adept at dealing with a topsy-turvy world,\" he said. \"The ecosystem is pretty resilient.\"\\r\\rSeveral ice shelves -- Prince Gustav Channel, Larsen Inlet, Larsen A, Larsen B, Wordie, Muller and Jones -- have collapsed in the past three decades, the British Antarctic Survey said.\\r\\rLarsen B, a 1,254-square-mile ice shelf, comparable in size to the U.S. state of Rhode Island, collapsed in 2002, the group said.\\r\\rScientists say the western Antarctic peninsula -- the piece of the continent that stretches toward South America -- has warmed more than any other place on Earth over the past 50 years, rising by 0.9 degrees Fahrenheit each decade.\\r\\rScambos said the poles will be the leading edge of what\\'s happening in the rest of the world as global warming continues.\\r\\r\"Even though they seem far away, changes in the polar regions could have an \\r',\n",

Write down EVERYTHING Abney puts on the chalkboard. His essays are pretty lame but he helps out quite a bit by giving you the information he wants. HINT: develop your essay outline directly from the instruction outline he passes out for the papers. His topics are complex (i.e. existence of God) but he\\'ll want you to remain somewhat linear in you arguments. Using his instruction outline will help you remain on-topic and receive a decent grade. And if Abney instructs, remember to include your outline at the front of your essay; a lot of students in my class forgot and lost points.    \\r\\rAs for testing, the quizzes are very difficult, but combined are worth only 10% of the total class grade (I missed two quizzes and didn\\'t study for the other two and that\\'s why I got a C in the class). The midterm and final exams were pretty easy - 33 questions each / multiple choice. The questions stuck with main topics.

There are some tricky questions, so you do need to have a full understanding of the concepts.  This can be accomplished by paying close attention to his class examples.  There are two argumentative essays.  He often gives you one or two arguments to start your essay which completes about half of the essay for you.  He provides other example arguments in class that require simple modification to meet the requirements of the essays.  Also, you can take your arguments to his office hours and he will gladly comment on them and even provide suggestions.  Overall, I found this class to be pretty easy.

He comes off as if he thinks he knows everything at first, but as the class progressed I realized that he was only presenting information about how the philosopher we were learning about would have believed.  So when he says something in a matter of fact manner, it is usually not because it is his own opinion, but rather because that is the opinion of that certain philosopher.  He makes the information fairly easy to understand, especially compared to trying to read and understand on your own.

The lectures are all covering the reading material and new content, and the reading assignments are lengthy, but not in depth, so you can usually take sparse notes and clarify key terms in class. \\rA downside to his class is that the lectures are very dense and very necessary. He spends every class going over a powerpoint that covers new material, so prudent note taking is crucial. He also doesn\\'t assign reading or study guides, so if you miss the class or don\\'t write something down, it\\'s on you to find it yourself.

She's really sweet and very helpful if you have any questions. She wants to make sure you excel and takes feedback about midterms well.\",\n",

       " 'Dr. Adams is a VERY nice woman who clearly LOVES developmental biology. It’s quite fun to learn from a professor who loves her subject so dearly. However, Dr. Adams is not an effective professor. She very rarely explains what it on her slides in an understandable way. On multiple occasions she was stared blankly at the powerpoint, then says “well, you guys get this”, before switching to the next slide. She will frequently read off of the figures on the slides saying “dorsal blastopore lip…mesenchyme…invagination”, which means very little to students who are learning this subject for the first time. Her first test was ridiculously easy, then the next one had an 18% drop in the average. She clearly did not realize how ineffective her teaching style was. Her labs were very interesting, but we wasted a record number of eggs/planaria/sea urchin plutei doing experiments that were repeatedly unsuccessful. I will take away very little knowledge from this class and it was significantly less applicable to my future studies than I had hoped. \\rOn a related note, this class should be renamed “Animal Developmental Biology” because we learned about humans maybe a combined hour of the entire quarter. ',\n",
       " 'Dr. Adams developmental biology course overall was fun. The material presented in the lecture and lab was not difficult to understand even without taking cell bio or mole bio lab. She did often skip over slides as if we had already understood them, but the repetitive theme of all the material covered in the course made up for that. The lab was the most fun lab out of any bio course I have taken before. The lab notebook was not too difficult because she gives you the rubric as a guide for what needs ot be in there. Times when I did go to office hours (twice all quarter) she did clarify my concerns.  ',\n",
       " 'I think its true that the negative comments from BIO 160 students are most likely because they are not used to having to work hard and memorize a ridiculous amount of material as a biology major.

She also cares a lot about her students, and puts in a huge amount of effort to make sure you succeed.

I've had her for ART 312 in the past, so I know her style of teaching well. Her upper-division art history classes are fairly low-stress classes. She has amazingly comprehensive lectures that are all based around the readings that she assigns for homework. With that said, you don't have to read the textbook to get a good grade in her class. The main benefit of reading the textbook is to gain more detailed understanding of the subject that will ensure an A. A good amount of students have gotten As on their tests without reading a single page of the textbook because her lectures are THAT good. I do suggest that you take notes in class because she doesn't upload lectures on PolyLearn, and usually a couple read-throughs of the notes will set you up nicely for the exams. She doesn't/very rarely assigns homework besides the readings, so your grade is based on the midterm(s) and final. You will generally write a compare essay for the exams and have a section of identifying the artists, titles, and dates of 10-15 art works you study. For this class (311), she had us group up every class session and write a short essay response to a prompt that she puts up on the board, and this ended up being excellent practice for the essays because it was a similar prompt to the essays. She didn't do the in-class writing assignments for my previous 312 class though. \\r\\rBesides the structure of her class, she is wonderfully passionate about the subject and inspires the same passion in her students.

She is a naturally intense person and gives extremely strict first-day lectures about plagiarism, but don\\\\'t let this put you off. Her lectures are never boring and she is actually an incredibly kind person. If you are interested in art, this class will be like visiting a museum and having an amazing tour guide.

She basically says: if you are lazy, don\\\\'t take this class. She puts every expectation on the table and explains that she is strict. This is true, but hey it\\\\'s upper division, that\\\\'s what one would expect. Thirdly, don\\\\'t let her monotone voice and constant floor pacing annoy you.

Students without prior horse knowledge often seem to get along with him becomes he comes across as confident and knowledgeable. But since I've had many years of experience with horses, I do not respect Pete's horsemanship. His teaching and training tactics for the horses are ineffective and often confusing. But most importantly, the reason that I do not like Pete is that he is extremely rude, opinionated, and confrontational. He constantly belittles and bullies students.

He doesn\\'t seem prepared to teach class, often beginning lecture up to 20 minutes passed the hour. Worse, any example he gives in class is usually a directed example from the textbook COPIED DIRECTLY from the textbook solutions manual IN CLASS!  Worse, he occasionally gets stuck while \"working\" on these example problems, writes the answer on the board, and moves on. He is confrontation to questions he finds as a nuisance, and can be difficult to understand.  All that being said, his lectures are generally garbage. They often won\\'t make sense if they are understandable at all. (He\\'s got a think accent. You\\'ll get used to it quickly, but it sometimes gets difficult to hear him at the back of a classroom or if he mumbles.) It was unsurprising that more than half the class skipped lecture or walked out early from it by the end of the semester. Although I attended lecture, I can honestly say I learned EXCLUSIVELY from the Textbook.\\r\\rIf He has one saving grace, it\\'s that he give \"easy\" exams. As a general rule, you get a one page cheat sheet. If you can do the homework, you can do the exam. JUST DON\\'T MISS AN EXAM or he might give you one composed of problems ripped from the textbook.',\n",

He solves THE WRONG problem on the homework solution at least once per assignment, and the grader (at least my grader) was too stupid too notice, instead marking my CORRECT homework wrong.\\r3) His pop quizzes can be characterized as \"pernicious.\" They are closed book, closed note.

His lectures are straight from his slides which are literally screen-grabs from the textbook summaries for equations. Thankfully he is too dumb to realize nobody learns shit in his class except the 3 equations for each transitor; so generally it is pretty easy if you write everything he has every written on the board onto your note sheet. It's funny, the one time someone that wasn't a student sat in one of our lectures (this was in 314), he completely changed his teaching style and did examples!!! fucking guy did 2 examples the entire 306 class.

His tests are questions from his notes!!!  The reason he got upset, like this idiot below me says, is because the kids in his classes don't appreciate his effort as much as they should.  Agbo simply comes from a different understanding of school- he is from Africa and he worked his ass off just to get where he is, so when he sees negligent kids, especially ones that do try to smear him, of course he gets pissed.  If you simply talk to this guy you will see what he is all about.  Don't assume what everyone else says to be true.

It's sad that this man knows so much and has such a hard time conveying it. He also is not very organized. This being said, you still have to read the book and study and all that normal stuff for any EE class. A lot of people in this major don't go to his class because they think the teacher isn't up to par or whatever. Guess what..you still gotta go to class. Learn to show some respect for the people who are imparting their knowledge to you, no matter their race, creed, orientation or teaching method. THEY KNOW MORE THAN YOU. WE AREN'T ENGINEERS YET. THEY ARE. GET OVER IT. Back to Agbo: His tests come out of his notes so you really need to take good notes and GO TO CLASS. The text is a good reference but you will not see many test questions (if any) from it. The homework can be a little gnarly but it does help to reinforce the lecture. He also curves a lot. If you are concentrating on communications, I would suggest taking another professor for the class, like Breitenbach. Yes, Breitenbach. Deal with it. If you aren't into commuications, then Agbo is fine. The bottom line is that Agbo teaches a LOT of different courses in EE and it's highly probable that you will have him at least once. Go to EVERY class, do the homework, know your trig identities or put them on the notesheet, and make sure your tests are VERY complete and you'll be fine.\",\n",

Agbo isn't the best or worst professor for this class, but since I'm not going into communications anyway, I'd take this prof over Breitenbach any day.

And when a group needed help setting up a circuit or figuring out why it wasn't working, he was unable to help at all. Multiple times that we had problems with our circuits, he tried to justify it with tolerances of chips etc., when our output was CLEARLY not what we should be getting. Other times he would just look at our circuit and say something was wrong but that he doesn't know what and we should start over again. Because of this, we usually had to stay at least another hour (for the later labs) after the three hours allotted. Also, his grader was absolutely terrible - marked many of the lab groups off when there was actually nothing wrong, and failed to write any comments on the labs whatsoever. Nobody had any idea what they were doing wrong and when Agbo was asked, he usually didn't even come up with an answer (but almost always refusing to change the grade).

The only indication you have of how you are doing are a few meetings with him. Assignments in this class are pretty easy, and I dont feel that I really learned much from them at all.

I don\\'t even know where to start, this man is simply an icon, let me see if I can give you an idea. \\r\\rFirst off, his stunning looks and impecable fashion sense. Picture a Joe Pesci like gremlin but with a leather tan. Now throw on a $15 suit from Ebay and a tie from Ross. Kriss Kross wore their clothes backwards, Bon Jovi had torn jeans and Michael Jackson had one glove . . .all fashion icons have a signature trait. Mohan\\'s is pulling his suit pants up to just below his pecs and then buying a belt 8 sizes too big for his waist. After fastening the belt 9 holes deep he lets the excess belt flap in the wind. Now you may think the popped collar or the aviator sunglasses are fashion statements but none of you had the forsight or the balls to wear the extra large belt. \\r\\rLets move on to the strut, much can said about a man by the way he walks. Mohan hardly even walks, it is more of a glide with his gut thrusted out with the slight shuffle of his feet. This can only be pulled off by a man with supreme confidence and style . . .Play on playa. \\r\\rOn to his classroom etiquite . . . if you are lucky enough to enter the light and the way that is a mohan classroom you won\\'t forget it. Mohan applies the rare technique of pop culture expertise (look for J Lo and Britney references) along with American custom mishaps (he will often call a male student \"mam\" or a female student \"sir\") then plays it off with this cackle of laughter that can best be described as one student said above like stepping on a turtle. \\r\\rThere are no boundaries with Mohan, my classmates and I soon discovered this and altered our questions from general marketing questions to questions about mohan\\'s family (the sacred agrawals) and alcohol, all of which he answered the best he could. We tried to get him to go downtown with us but being the true gentelmen he is he passed. Mohan lives out loud and loves unconditionally. He invited me to Vegas with him (which would have been epic but I passed), wore a t-shirt over his suit with his face on it that said \"You can\\'t have MO with out the Han\" or something like that and threw a pizza party for us on our last day of class (just like in third grade!) all in one quarter. . . .and that is just the tip of the iceberg. \\r\\rYou can tell how much he cares for his students when he gives his farwell speech on the last day of class. He tears up like the fragile girl in elementry school that gets blind sided during a game of dodgeball. \\r\\rWords of advice for a prospective mohan disciple: \\r1) Don\\'t show up late or else he will make you his personal pinata. \\r\\r2) If he offers you something (like pizza) don\\'t turn it down, I think it is offensive from where he comes from. \\r\\r3) When he calls on you just start talking and look for the mohan sign of acceptance. This is defined by mohan stopping his forward like moonwalk across the class and then he turns to face you. He will cross his arms and start shaking his head tenaciously like a bobble head. Once you are here you are golden . .just keep talking. \\r\\rI don\\'t think Mohan is even at Cal Poly anymore which is an absoulte shame but if you have the chance to study abroad . . .Go to India and find this man and take his class.

You just have to attempt the homework questions to get credit. You don't have to finish them all or get them right. If you can't do some of them, just ask him to go over them in class. All the tests are fair and are very similar to the homework. I went back and did a few questions out of every section to prepare for the midterm and did well. Don't misunderstand. Calculus II is a lot work no matter whom you have. You have to complete and assignment every night. If you're not willing to put in the work, you'll fail the class, just like with any other teacher.

Homework is due the next class period, but all you have to do is try to do your homework to get full credit.  The students take turns checking, so you need to make only a minimal effort.  He assigns a fair load of homework problems, not too many.  Test problems are from the homework, so make sure to study it.  The tests are reasonably graded so that little mistakes will not get you a huge deduction as long you know what you are doing.  The tests did have some really challenging problems and the final has some really hard problems.  But nothing impossible is on the test and lengthwise, they are doable in less than 50 minutes.  You get a sheet of notes on the exam, so you do not have to do any strenuous memorizing at all.  So do whatever it takes to get this guy.

He is much of the same way in class in the fact that he really tries to make sure you understand and he is very understanding if you don't.  The only thing that I could possibly criticize is that his teaching style is a little unorthodoxe from some of my math teacher's in the past.  His teaching lesson that he has when he comes into the class doesn't seem too concrete when he is presenting it.  Of course it just maybe because it was a hard ass class.

Perhaps Javi should work on improving his teaching style instead of writing fake reviews to offset all the bad ones. Notice that the previous review was the only person to report an A with most students not displaying a grade or not doing well. Also, I find it highly unlikely a Junior took chemistry as a General Ed course as reported on the last review, and if someone\\'s actually done that, they need to reconsider their life choices.',\n",

By far, Javier is the worst professor I have ever had. He wastes incredible amounts of time, constantly reminds you that he is smarter than you, and has zero structure for lecture. Quizzes do not reflect the lecture, there is no homework to guide learning, and you never know what will be presented in class. Not only is he a bad professor, he is not a pleasant person to be around either. Avoid for your own sake.',\n",

During the labs, if you ask perfectly reasonable questions he says you should already know it, or to read the prelab, making him seem arrogant and unapproachable. His quizzes are weekly and are extremely hard, often he tests on material that he hasn't taught in the class. I heard going to his office hours are a little more helpful than just listening to his lectures. Very difficult to learn chemistry from this dude.\",\n",

He also likes to throw \"curveball\" questions that are badly worded and based on concepts we were supposed to remember from Chem 124. Even when the majority of the class gets the answer wrong, he won\\'t fully explain it or even curve the quiz making the class average on most quizzes 50% or less. \\rLectures: He always rushes through key concepts and skips over example problems because he says we don\\'t have time. He copy and pastes example problems onto his slides, gives you like 2 minutes to do them, then shows you a copy and pasted answer for .2 seconds. If you ask him to go back he says, \"You didn\\'t snap chat it?\".... not kidding. I had his class for 3 hour chunks twice a week and we consistently finished 45 min to an hour early, even though we supposedly didn\\'t have time to spend on key concepts and example problems. He is not organized or time efficient.\\rLabs: These are probably the one part of this class he doesn\\'t fuck up. That\\'s probably because labs are standardized throughout the department so he doesn\\'t have a chance to fuck them up. \\rAdvice: Don\\'t take him at all costs. If you absolutely have to take him, here\\'s some stuff that could help. Make sure you read the book extremely carefully. Take a picture of the board when he does quiz corrections because they won\\'t be posted online. Go to his office hours and be polite or else he will just answer all your questions with \"that was in your book, didn\\'t you read?\" or \"google it\" or tell you that you asked a good question and then walk away. Be best friends with the TAs because they will be a million more times helpful explaining things than he will. \\rOverall, \"Javy\" as he likes to call himself, is an unorganized, unhelpful, arrogant kind of teacher.

When asked questions, he rarely gives answers and will halt class to get multiple students\\' opinions instead of just giving a correct answer. He doesn\\'t curve his tests, quizzes, or labs; even if every single person fails a question or a quiz, he says we need to study more instead of looking at himself to see if he facilitated learning on it.

When I compared my quiz to another student, I noticed that other students who did not show any work received full credit.

His quizzes don't really happen but when they do they are very specific to the reading and his lecture, and don't reflect what was on the lab write up. He is very helpful in office hours, going over everything on the lab to basically ensure 100 on your lab. However he is a bit of a struggle during class. He expects you read the lab so you will have 0 questions on how to do things, so don't ask questions during lab or he'll assume you didn't read the lab/threaten to take away technique points. We were sort of the Guinea pig class for him but he didn't acknowledge this fact so we felt the burn.

Yes, Ahern tends to ramble off topic and he'll put random charts up and never really clearly explain what it is. He could also help his students out by actually breaking each chapter up into sections with clearly labeled names to make studying easier. However, I think he's a much easier teacher than Hurley. For one, his final is only 2 hours long, instead of 6, because he knows its ridiculous to have a six hour final. His midterms are difficult to study for because the questions are usually conceptual and don't involve a lot of math, which is strange in an Econ class.

He mentioned to the class in almost exact wording that \"that wasn\\'t really your grade on the paper, just something I put on there because students like to see letters.\" Everyone just kind of looked at each other and laughed quietly, confused with that ridiculous and totally ineffective philosophy. If anything that made me take the class less seriously which is never a good sign. Oh yeah and the week after the midterm when he started saying everything wrong and having students correcting him wasn\\'t too reassuring either. I quit going after the 3rd week because I wasn\\'t getting anything from the lecture, and was afraid I was going to be taught something wrong if another student didn\\'t catch the mistake. You can take that for whatever you want, I\\'m a slacker, the class was too hard for me, whatever.

So if you take him and end up without the proper fundamentals for transistor circuits, there is no hope for you in EE307 unless you are really smart or you work really hard. My suggestion is to take EE306 with a good teacher like Braun who is hard. When you are done with the course you will have learned much more than a BJT characteristic curve.

His efforts in teaching and evaluation of students is definitely inadequate.\\r\\rOn lectures:\\rHe prepares minimally for lectures and example problems. A majority of his lectures will be entirely \"Does anyone have any homework problems they want to go over?\"\\rHe does not review any material before lecture. When he covers a homework problem or example problem, he needs to relearn it in class. This is a large waste of time. Due to this lack of preparation, he makes significant mistakes in the process and calculations, leading to the example problem being not being finished.\\rMost professors prepare lecture notes so they can maintain an organized structure for their lecture. However, Ahlgren does not. He writes what comes to his mind in class.\\r\\rOn Exams:\\rHis course consists of 3 exams: two midterms and a final. These are all done with multiple choice scantrons, of approximately 15-20 questions. \\rFor roughly 3-5 questions on each, Ahglren messes up. By messes up, I mean he does not use the correct equations or he makes arithmetic errors. As a result, none of the available answer choices will be correct. This is bad because it makes students confused and doubtful during the exam, making them perform worse by having less time. These tests are time constrained, losing this amount of time is not an insignificant factor.\\rHis errors could be prevented through self review, peer review, or using a written exam instead of scantron. I think any of these options would be an entirely reasonable amount of effort. However, it appears he never tries these. Instead, he tells students to tell him if they think Ahlgren is wrong, or pick the closest answer. The tests are too ambiguous and time constrained to tell him he is wrong. Picking the closest answer is also unsettling. \"Closest answer\" usually does not mean a rounding error, it usually means a massive difference. For example, the \"closest\" to (-1/3) is (+0.28), or the \"closest\" to (100e^-350.0) is (19.0). The first example is the wrong sign, and the magnitude is impossible to be from rounding error.  The second example is literally a difference of 152 orders of magnitude (10^152 times different). \\rAfter exams, points lost due to Ahlgren\\'s mistakes are usually given back. However, he is stubborn and irrational in this process.

He was super new, and I understand not everyone can be a great professor in their first quarter teaching. This aside, I have never felt more confused, frustrated, and lost in a class. He never presented information clearly, and couldn\\'t understand how to answer questions. This was the first time I had ever taken physics, but he taught to the class like we all should know what is going on. He just kind of spit out words and hoped we would absorb them, and some people did. I unfortunately didn\\'t, and I can honestly say I\\'ve never felt more stupid that sitting in this class. When people asked questions to clarify things, he would repeat what he just and then say \"okay?\" and move on. After the midterm (which he waited until week 6 for us to take), I had to get a tutor just to make sure I passed the class. I learned more from the tutor in three hours a week than I did in any of the time Adeel spent lecturing.I\\'m not writing this out of being bitter for getting a C, because I can honestly say its a miracle I passed the class. I\\'m just trying to give my perspective on how the quarter went. I know a lot of people in that class aced everything and did perfectly fine. but coming from someone who can usually do pretty well teaching themselves, definitely only take this class if you\\'re either a)naturally a genius at physics or b)mentally prepared.',\n",

To my understanding, Adeel didn't have a lot of experience. At times, this showed. He would often ask us to solve problems before teaching us HOW to solve them.... being an hour long class, we usually got through two problems max, or had to stop half way through a problem and start back up the next day, which made things even more confusing. He sometimes rushed through problems or taught them to the white board rather than the class. He always stopped to ask if we had questions, but he wasn't always able to answer them in ways we could understand. His accent was very noticeable but wasn't really distracting nor did it take away from our ability to learn. I put in minimal work for this class, barely understood anything, and came out with a B- thanks to how he grades/weighs things. He doesn't collect homework, but it's very helpful (not that I did it...), grades are based solely off quizzes, tests, and participation. If you're actually looking to understand physics, I wouldn't take him. But if you're just looking to pass a required class, he's not that bad.\",\n",

Some concepts took way too long to explain and felt somewhat convoluted, but given that it was his first quarter teaching I cut him slack for that and I think he just needs experience to cut back on the misuse of lecture time. And super nice btw I had to miss class for an exam and he allowed me to take it during office hours, and patient too\",\n",

All the info was from the textbook, so by the end of the quarter I had hardly any class notes. Second, most of the questions on the exams didn't have a clear answer or had multiple answers that seemed correct.

The midterm and final are  traditional multiple choice  and true/false exams. The information for the exams come directly from the lecture (~70%) and the book/context reader (~30%). Exams are very manageable and fair, not to mention he curves the exams by a few points. On top of the curve, he offers up to 7% points of EASY extra credit points by doing small writing assignments throughout the quarter. Dr. Alaniz makes getting an A+ in this class VERY doable. The only downside to this class is that you must attend class to get notes because he doesn’t post the slides on Polylearn.

Do the Intro to Sociology readings, because they will show up on the text, but just skim the contexts reader and note the general argument because there will only be general questions about them.

       " \"**CONSERVATIVE STUDENT BE INFORMED**  I'm writing this just for you, because the previous reviews were not helpful enough for me.\\r\\rThe Professor:\\rI saw Professor Alaniz had fantastic ratings so I thought this will be a great class. WRONG! He is very sly about the way he presents his views. He gets students to laugh by saying F*** a lot. He says he is only presenting theories to consider. He tries to appear unbiased and open to discussion, but they are so blatantly LIBERAL. He uses GUILT to try and persuade you to his views. What class was like: [Anti-American Socialism, capitalism is terrible, America was built on the backs of the poor, colonization is the reason we have poor countries, we are responsible to help the poor countries cause we ruined them in the first place, you have the privilege of ignorance, you are an awful human being cause you buy Starbucks, which exploits the poor and really isn't fair trade, meat is the reason we have global warming, etc.. you get the idea] It was difficult to tune out the liberal agenda. If you have no choice, you will survive, I did. Don't let it get to you and realize there is this thing called OPINION, which is different than fact. He gets you to really think about what you believe and why. It made me appreciate history so much more, and how important it is to know rather than just believe what you're told. He seems to have a huge heart for the poor, but his solution is to take the money from the rich and give it to the poor. Overall, He shows up on time. He is extremely passionate about his views. \\r\\rThe Class itself:\\rThere are heavy daily readings with possible pop quizzes. You get 0.5 of a point for writing your name on your paper and leaving it blank (admitting to not reading). You get no points if you BS the quiz. You get 2 points for the correct answer. Overall these don't count that much in your grade, but it is good to know the reading for the 1 Midterm and 1 Final. There are a few papers that are graded super easy if you add a poor them attitude into it. The midterm and final were really hard (I didn't do my reading), and took a lot of studying. He gives you a study guide which is basically bullet points of the whole class (AKA not really a study guide). Someone in my class made a google doc for the whole class. We filled in the definitions and our notes, which I totally recommend taking advantage of, but it was still hard.\",\n",
       " 'Alaniz is a great guy. This class made me feel more knowledgable about the world we live in and made me feel passionate to take greater care of each other. This class will educate you on far more than just academics if you listen to what he is saying. I took this class instead of Econ for one of my D GE\\'s, and I am so happy I made this decision. I feel way more politically and socially informed after taking this class and I think that anybody that has the opportunity to take this class should. As far as workload, it is totally easy to get an A or B in this class. He assigns readings every night (which I think were pretty excessive), but they do show up on the exams. If just while you\\'re studying for the tests you skim each reading and understand who the author is, what the author stands for, and what the main points are than you should be fine. In lecture, he will every once in a while give random \"participation\" points where you have to answer some question about the reading. If you show up, you get 50% credit on the participation and if you did the reading too then you get 100%. He gives 4 assignments throughout the quarter which are a majority of your grade and are super easy to get an A on.  Just follow the rubric closely. The exams felt pretty hard when I was taking them but I think that was just because I didn\\'t really do the readings. When studying, make sure you study the readings just as much as the lecture notes. He gives you a short answer at the end of the exam and tells you the prompt beforehand so you can prepare. So, he\\'s basically giving you free points on a quarter of the test. He also gave us an extra credit assignment that bumped our midterm grade up a whole letter. Overall, I love Alaniz and if you let it, this class will really inspire and enlighten you. The workload is totally manageable and it\\'s an easy A if you show up to lecture and do the assignments.

       " \"Alaniz is such a stand up teacher that I risked taking a 7 am with him Spring Quarter. Not only is Alaniz's class very manageable in terms of homework, but he fully explains every subject within lectures and makes it very easy for students to comprehend concepts discussed both in class and out. I barely did any of the readings, but took notes in class everyday, and pulled away with an A. The class is incredibly interesting, and critical of many organizations and standards that modern society takes for granted/accepts blindly. Alaniz presents logical and well supported evidence to present his arguments, and is able to defend them if asked. Much of the class is intended to challenge student's mindsets rather than their ability to memorize. Aside from the class, Alaniz is a generally inspiring, kind and funny guy, and a good teacher. He also brought baby goats into class for our only midterm (if you weren't already convinced to take his class). \",\n",

He seem like an experienced, passionate teacher who would present the material in an interesting way; however, this was not the case. He straight up lied about multiple statistics to stoke his ego which completely devalued the class because I didn't believe anything he said after. Additionally, all of his powerpoint are outdated (he does not post them online) and it is clear that he puts almost no effort into the class. When I attempted to have a conversation with him on a reading he had no idea what I was talking about and it was clear he had not read it. I do not understand how he has a good rating. It is not worth waking up at 7 am for!\",\n",
       " 'Dr. Alaniz\\'s class was incredibly biased, and tried to paint a negative view of capitalism without providing a broader context of its benefits. He relied very heavily on anecdotal evidence in most of his lectures and never seemed to fully comprehend the course which he was teaching. When students asked him even basic questions about the course and its material, he very rarely answered with anything other than \"I don\\'t know.\" His lectures often presented outdated, false, or biased information, claiming that he hoped students would \"decide for themselves.\" The course hardly dealt with matters of Political Economy at all, eschewing both the political and the economic side of the subject. Instead, Dr. Alaniz trashed economic indicators and charitable organizations, claimed that every product in our economy is exploitative, and attempted to guilt people out of purchasing anything made internationally. His course deals less with the interactions of politics and economies on the international scale, and more on the hardships of individuals in various \"Global South\" (developing) countries. Dr. Alaniz\\'s class appeared to have a clear agenda that he attempted to force onto his students. His examinations would often present questions (especially True or False questions) that were matters of opinion, and had no single answer.\\r\\rDr. Alaniz is a well-intentioned person. However, his International Political Economy course leaves much to be desired. ',\n",

For example, we had class two times a week on Tuesday and Thursday. Halloween this year was on a Wednesday, and for whatever reason he decided to put the midterm at 7 am the Thursday after Halloween instead of the Tuesday before like alright then. He also makes passive aggressive comments in class sometimes.

Tests are harsh but doesn't cover most of the grade, attendance matters - 20% this Fall quarter, group project and presentation - which I feel like he has graded it easier and online quizzes which are impossible to not get an A.

I don't think (or a least I hope) English is his first language and this shows in the labs and questions he writes cause myself and many other students to loose points on labs and midterms due to ambiguous and oft unintelligible wording of his questions. \\rThis was an easy class so it really showed how incompetent Dekhtyar was at facilitating learning for even the most basic of materials. Others have told me that he slacks off in this class because it is not interesting and he performs better for more advanced classes in this series but the absolute buffoonery I saw this stumbling, stuttering, overweight, mess of a man partake in during my experience in this class was enough to make me avoid any classes taught by him.\\rSo be warned Dekhtyar could be a good teacher but his general buffoonery prevents him from being anything more than the jester of the CS department.\",\n",

Some important information about any class you take in his class: 1) Alex knows his shit! Anyone who says otherwise should be ignored. Whether its for class or anything remotely related to databases or data science, Alex is a fantastic resource during office hours. 2) Alex considers lab assignments to be small-scale projects. Yes, these involve more work than most 'lab assignments' at Cal Poly but Alex is very very flexible with due dates (WHEN YOU COMMUNICATE WITH HIM). These projects are very practical and excellent material to discuss with interviewers BECAUSE they are more involved. 3) Individual and group projects are extremely educational! Almost always, the project allows you to apply whatever you have been learning in lecture / labs to something you find interesting. The projects force students to think about how to tackle problems that contain the full software development lifecycle (from the inception of the idea to design to the implementation to presenting these results) I cannot emphasize how valuable these experiences have been in preparing me for industry. 4) If you need an extremely engaging and meticulously organized lecturer... Do NOT take his class. Despite this shortcoming, he is great at answering questions in class or in office hours. (In my experience, the people who complain the most, do very little to help themselves and expect to be spoon-fed the answers to everything) 5) I have never had to purchase a textbook for a course with Alex! If you excel at learning from the notes or assignments, you will do just fine in his classes. (Read the notes ahead of time / during lecture. Pay attention to the examples he does so you can gauge what will be on the midterms...)\",\n",

Instead of turning in source code, the primary deliverable for most labs and projects is a written report. Generally, Dekhtyar's lectures are interesting and fun to attend and he is very charismatic. Although class is fun, Dekhtyar's lectures are consistently very difficult to follow; although he does compensate for this with extremely useful pre-printed lecture notes. His lectures cater to individuals with prior experience with data mining which can be very problematic for the average computer science student. Most labs and projects require a massive time commitment (10 to 20 hours) for good results. Almost all assignments are group based. Be EXTREMELY careful in picking a lab partner. Overall I feel that I learned a lot about data mining but the time commitment was very unreasonable at times (4 assignments simultaneously). Take this class if you want to learn a lot, but not if you want to raise your GPA.\",\n",

One of the projects is a design project where you have to create a system that uses data mining. The second one basically consists of finding something interesting in a data set using data mining and reporting on it. The programs could be time consuming, but they're basically just implementing pseudocode of the algorithms talked about during lecture. The second project that used data mining to determine stuff about data was interesting and relevant to the course. I felt the design project was more based on how creatively you could use data and didn't contribute as much to the course. No exams, but you do have two presentations - one on your initial idea for the design project and a final presentation on the design project.\",\n",

The Required book for this course is outrageously expensive and in my honest opinion useless since she goes over all of the things that are to be tested. There are just a few questions that the book goes over though. One nice thing about this course is that on the midterms she gives the students an opportunity for extra credit that can boost your grade up by 5 points! That could easily boost your B+ to an A- or A. There is also a really fun art project that is worth as much as the midterms.

This is your typical GE lecture class that runs over the readings over and over again even though she assigns the readings as homework and you actually go through the entire book (25 Chapters) over the quarter.

As a result, she spouted off large amounts of objective facts and dates rather than commenting on thematic elements of the texts. Her one midterm was extremely hard, writing intensive, and long.

I\\'m especially disappointed in her as an upper-div Engl professor. ALL she cares about in essays is format format format. Since high school I\\'ve been taught to try and not be formulaic in my writing. By junior year as an English major I had become accustomed to teacher\\'s grading my papers based on the content--my ideas, writing style, interpretations. But not so with Allen. After she took over a f*cking month return a very short paper I was very disappointed to see that almost all the comments were regarding minor errors in MLA format--the only praise she gave me on the whole paper was how I had formatted the heading correctly. And honestly, the amount of time it takes her to return a paper is terrible--I know this is a very common complaint among English departments, but her turn-around rate (for *short* papers) is the worst I\\'ve seen in a CLA teacher. And she comes off as hypocritical since she\\'s very very rigid about late policies.

For the midterm and the final it is imporatant to have a general recollection of all of the authors and their work.

She basically expects you to be able to write like an English major and read about 50 pages twice a week. Extremely time consuming class for just a general ed class. If you are going to take this for USCP, C4, and GWR credit, you\\\\'re better off with taking an easier C4 class that\\\\'s also USCP and just taking the GWR test. She is an extremely hard grader, like previously said, and you are more likely to pass the GWR test than to pass the GWR in her class.

Apparently that warrants expulsion and failing. Had Dr. Allen addressed this issue in a timely manner, I wouldn't have a problem.  But she was blatantly disrespectful and inconsiderate.

I don't know what else we could've asked from her.  Her expectations are clear and I was never confused as to what it is she wanted for a given assignment, or what kind of work would earn an A, B, C, etc. The tests were comprised of passages taken from works we read over the quarter, many of which we discussed in class.  As long as you keep up on the reading and do a little review before the test, you'll do well.  She is a very tough grader, especially on essays and papers, but I felt like she was genuinely interested in helping to improve my writing.  I found her engaging, and if you are having a hard time, I would definitely suggest talking to her.

She is a strict grader, but it was also a graduate course...that is the point of graduate school.  She was very reasonable with the material.  Everything we read was on the MA reading list and was taught for our benefit.  Her personality is great and she is very approachable.

Copy Editing was, for the most part, not helpful at all. Lectures were disorganized, grading standards unclear, and she would sometimes come in exhausted and unprepared. It was an easy class requiring little work overall, but it felt like everything you actually did do was busy work. I wouldn't say my editing skills improved much. In Journalism Ethics, on the other hand, Allen was awesome. She seemed energized by the subject matter and was always prepared. Her lectures were meaningful and she put great stock in student discussion. It was also in the afternoon, so she actually seemed very alert. At the end of all this I can only assume 2 things. A) She doesn't enjoy copy editing at all, and B) She isn't a morning person. That being said, she and Soares are the only professors in the department that I believe really bring something to it. Ramos is arrogant, Murray unclear, and Munroe wastes your time. Sosna wasn't awful, but his lectures can be pointless. Long story short: Allen is imperfect, but a lot better than most. I'd recommend her, particularly for Ethics.\",\n",

Her teaching style allows for mistakes because she knows we aren't perfect, we're just learning. Going to office hours is helpful for her class!

The essays you write are not bad at all, they are pretty easy topics because by the time you get the prompt the            theme has been beaten into your head... and she is a fairy easy grader when is comes to the essays.

Most of the people who say they don't like her just didn't put effort into the class. (And honestly, it doesn't require that much effort in the first place.) A lot of people just didn't understand AP style in my copy editing class, and it showed up on their tests so they were bummed. And then they ranted about how useless editing is. Boy, are they wrong.

Its hard now a days not having Alongi for 143, I have these high standards and frankly grad students don\\'t make the grade, ha no pun intended.  he he.  Yeah so take Alongi or always live in regret.Ps.  He told us that we would get 5% higher for the quarter if we used his name as a measurement, and make sure its lower case. Wink wink nudge nudge say no more.',\n",
       " 'Put simply Professor Alongi is the best instructor I have ever had at any level of education. He has an amazing ability to present material extremely clearly and effectively. Professor Alongi is obsessed with making sure his students truly do understand what he is trying to teach, after every important point he makes he will stop and ask \"is it clear?\". He is a very nice guy and is always open to questions. One thing I would like to get straight is that I don\\'t generally like math, but Professor Alongi actually made calculus class enjoyable (its sounds like an oxymoron I know) he has a great sense of humor and is not afraid to show a little enthusiasm when he is excited about something. However his class is not an easy calc class, I took Kirk for 141 and that was a joke. If you want an easy A then take Kirk or one of the other easy instructors, but if you want to actually learn calculus and not dread going to calc class every day take Alongi.  ',\n",

He is kinda strict when it comes to adminstrative things (no late homework, be punctual to class, etc) but that's the price you have to pay for a great teacher.  The only problem was that he doesn't really go over homework, but if you're confused, go to office hours.  He is always willing to help and I was there almost weekly.  The tests are quizzes are tough and although I understood it when he presented it, I had difficulty applying it.  Still, he is the best math teacher I probably have ever had (do not take van lingen!).\",\n",

       " \"I took Alongi over the last summer quarter for math 142.  The class started out very slowly, and went he into detail on some easy shit.  The class sped up a bit near the end, because the stuff was new.  When going over formulas he almost always proved them before writing them out, which is good if you like to undertand the concepts.  He was easy to understand and drew frightfully good pictures. (I've never seen anyone draw a perfect circle with chalk)  His quizzes were easy, but his tests were kinda tough.  You pretty much know what to expect on the tests though, so make sure you know how to every kind of problem.  I messed up on the midterm so I ended up getting a B.  I highly recommend him, and according to his ratings, other people do to. \",\n",

Of course, they're usually the two problems you had lots of trouble doing.  Luckily, his tests and quizzes are worth far more, and he tries to bring problems out of the homework or cover them well in class.

His quizes are usually pretty easy, but his exams are worth a large part of your grade, so you have to really prepare.

From then on i did not really feel comfortable approaching him, or maybe it is because i am a bit shy.  Many other kids said that he is a very easy approachable man.  But i was a bit biased about that because almost always made me late for my next class by always going 5 minutes after the hour doing more examples.  He does explain the material in detail, or as i think the LONG way of doing things.  but on the plus side he does many examples of each possible way so its pretty hard to not understand something. he is also VERY helpful duringn office hours. on a typical week you will do new material from monday through thursday and then will go over questions of friday and have a 10min quiz. if you like to know where many of the equations and theorums come from he is the perfect teacher to take, but get ready for a scream fest.  he has two midterms and he grades very fair.  the final was a bit difficult but study hard and you will do well. he assigns a good amount of homework everyday and collects it.  he is ANAL about showing work and just a bit OCD... he can draw perfect circles and incredibly straight lines.

Of course, that led to just about every class going a minute or two past the bell, but it was well worth it.  I definitely overstudied for tests (but hey, I got the grade); they aren't that bad, but definitely not a cake walk either.

It's not like the problem was extremely important or anything.  \\r\\rI like how he tells you most of the time what will be on the quizzes and midterms, although not exactly of course.  He likes to throw tricky stuff your way as far as integrals go though.  \\r\\rHe goes through a lot of proofs and derivations which are very unnecesary.  He also doesn't always make it clear what you actually need to know and what are the useful formulas in actually doing the problems.  The lecture could be at least half the length if he didn't do all the proofs and what not.  \\r\\rI'd actually recommend taking him.  As for advice, I'd say make sure you know the different ways of solving integrals and have done practice problem; don't worry about the matrix stuff, it's easy; and only write down the important stuff, as in the formulas, definitions, and stuff, don't worry about other people that write down everything, they're dumb.\",\n",

Her tests are a little challenging, but as long as you actually did the lab and not just copied then you should be fine.  overall Susi is a great professor and my favorite one at Cal Poly. I would definately recommend taking one of her classes.  ',\n",
       " 'First off this is a tough lab. it is two days a week and covers a lot of material. the main grade for the lab is your lab notebook. she grades it all at the end of the quarter and gives you strict guidelines and how to get a good grade one it. \\r\\ralthough the class did have a lot of material, susi taught the material well and it was easy to understand. she goes out of her way as a teacher to make sure the students know what is going on and understand the concepts, not just definitions and memorization. \\r\\rim pretty sure this is a bio major specific class and it might discourage you to switch majors (i know at least three in my lab who switched because of this class) so it seems to me like this is a weeding class for bio majors. my suggestion is to stick with it and if you are having trouble in the lab, do better in the lecture. the grading is 50% lecture 50% lab so its easy to get a decent grade in the overall course.',\n",

       " 'I really enjoyed this course. Her lectures contain PowerPoint (posted on PL) and some discussions. The labs were very hands-on. Also, great opportunities to work closer with dairy cattle including deep understanding on reproduction by participating in activities in lab. Only three tests, some quizzes in lab, and some worksheets. Not hard if you do the study! Overall, Altermatt is very friendly and knowledgeable, I would take her! ',\n",
       " 'Dr. Joy is one of the best professors I’ve taken at Poly. She is understanding, knowledgeable, and approachable. This course was not easy, but between being present in lectures and lab, and making time for office hours, it was doable. 3 exams (fine if you study), some worksheets, one out of class activity, and labs. It’s a high point class, and just showing up gets you quite far. ',\n",
       " \"Joy's class was ridiculously difficult to keep up in. She assumes you already have an advanced knowledge of the dairy reproductive system and is difficult to follow during lectures. Maybe it was because she was pregnant and stressed but she was always very unorganized and exams were not well written or related to her lectures and lab activities. Take it with someone else if you can!\",\n",

Highly recommend this class and this professor. \",\n",

       " 'Brian Altock actually reads the papers and essays that are turned into him, sometimes spending thirty minutes on each paper. His comments that are written on the papers provide excellent insight into his thoughts as well as showing how to improve your writing. he takes this help even further by being open in office hours and spending as much time as needed to help you understand your writing (the good and the bad). \\r\\rIn class he is understanding and often brings fresh media/topics into discussions. \\r\\rHe renewed my interest in wrinting and the importance of discussion.\\r\\rPick him if you can',\n",
       " 'Altrock is incredibly cool in class and in office hours. However, when it comes to grading, he\\'s a little bitch. He always promised to give us our papers back \"tomorrow,\" but would come up with excuses every day of why he didn\\'t have them. \"Tomorrow guys... I was real sick this weekend (cough, cough).\" Bullshit. The beginning of the quarter I thought he was totally cool, now I think he\\'s a total douche. Everyone I have talked to has had chill teachers, so definitely avoid Altrock if you can. He makes me hate writing and his comments are so discouraging.',\n",
       " \"Alright so I read what the other two said and i agree with parts of both but that one is harsh so im here to defend Altrock. He is a great guy, very funny and pretty understanding if you actually go to his office hours. But he is a rough grader although Im not gunna lie most of my papers were done the night..morning of. Anyways I know if I actually put in a decent amount of effort, I could have swung an A. All in all Brian's awesome and your grade is reflective what you put into the class. Oh and hes VERY Irish so if ya tease him a lil bout that you're in, but in moderation. \",\n",
       " \"This guy is unusual but he is a great professor, who actually reads essays papers you submit, so don\\\\'t BS. The best part is if you get a bad grade you can go into his office hours and then redo a paper for a better grade, and he doesn\\\\'t even average the grades. I really liked his class, and he made me like English. He also understands student stresses, and one day showed Finding Forester and then had us write in our journals about it, which the journals are graded based on what we did. Bottom line try to get him if you actually like writing about your personal opinions/topic you like, if you like to BS papers for a grade don\\\\'t take him.\",\n",
       " 'I have the Beyond Words textbook if he is still requiring you buy it for way less money than at the bookstore.. You barely use it during the quarter anyway but he has a couple of journal assignments you need it for. ',\n",
       " \"He teaches the course as if it is the only class your taking and assigns papers as you come and go from class.  Also if you do end up taking him, it doesn\\\\'t matter when you choose your class times because he make mandatory visits into his office hours to turn in your papers.  BTW don\\\\'t ask him questions because he will go on a rant for 15 minutes about random stuff barely relating to your topic.\",\n",
